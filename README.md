# Creating VPN Endpoints on OpenStack

These templates and instructions are provided to help you create a VM in your OpenStack project, 
performing the task of a VPN endpoint, allowing secure connections to be made to other projects, 
vCloud Director VDCs, or back to your own infrastructure in-house.

For instructions on how to use the OpenStack HEAT template to deploy a VPN endpoint, please see
the instructions in the [wiki](https://github.com/UKCloud/vpn-on-openstack/wiki).
